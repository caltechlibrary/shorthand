    shorthand [OPTIONS] [FILES_TO_PROCESS]

## SYNOPSIS

_shorthand_ is a command line utility to expand labels based on their assigned definitions. 
The render output is the transformed text and without the shorthand definitions 
themselves. _shorthand_ reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

### ASSIGNMENTS AND EXPANSIONS

Shorthand is a simple label expansion utility. It is based on a simple key 
value substitution.  It supports this following types of definitions

+ Assign a string to a LABEL
+ Assign the contents of a file to a LABEL
+ Assign the output of a Bash shell expression to a LABEL
+ Assign the output of a _shorthand_ expansion to a LABEL
+ Read a file of _shorthand_ assignments and assign any expansions to the LABEL
+ Output a LABEL value to a file
+ Output all LABEL values to a file
+ Output a LABEL assignment statement to a file
+ Output all assignment statements to a file

_shorthand_ replaces the LABEL with the value assigned to it whereever it is 
encountered in the text being passed. The assignment statement is 
not written to stdout output.

Notes: Using an underscore as a LABEL means the label will be ignored. 
There are no guarantees of order when writing values or assignment 
statements to a file.

The spaces surrounding 

```
   " :label: ", " :import-text: ", " :bash: ", " :expand: ", " :export: ", etc. 
```

are required.

### PROCESSING MARKDOWN PAGES

_shorthand_ also provides a markdown processor. It uses the [blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday) 
markdown library.  This is both a convience and also allows you to treat 
markdown with _shorthand_ assignments as a template that renders HTML or 
HTML with _shorthand_ ready for expansion. It is a poorman's text 
rendering engine.

In this example we'll build a HTML page with _shorthand_ labels from 
markdown text. Then we will use the render HTML as a template for a blog 
page entry.

Our markdown file serving as a template will be call "post-template.md". It 
should contain the outline of the structure of the page plus some _shorthand_ labels 
we'll expand later.

```
    # @blogTitle

    ## @pageTitle

    ### @dateString

    @contentBlocks
```

For the purposes of this exercise we'll use _shorthand_ as a repl and just enter 
the assignments sequencly.  Also rather than use the output of _shorthand_ directly 
we'll build up the content for the page in a label and use _shorthand_ itself to write 
the final page out.

The steps we'll follow will be to 

1. Read in our markdown file page.md and turn it into an HTML with embedded _shorthand_ labels
2. Assign some values to the labels
3. Expand the labels in the HTML and assign to a new label
4. Write the new label out to are page call "page.html"

Start the repl with this version of the _shorthand_ command:

```
    shorthand -p "? "
```

The _-p_ option tells _shorthand_ to use the value "? " as the prompt. When _shorthand_ starts 
it will display "? " to indicate it is ready for an assignment or expansion.

The following assumes you are in the _shorthand_ repl.

Load the mardkown file and transform it into HTML with embedded _shorthand_ labels

```
    @doctype :bash: echo "<!DOCTYPE html>"
    @headBlock :label: <head><title>@pageTitle</title>
    @pageTemplate :import-markdown: post-template.md
    @dateString :bash: date
    @blogTitle :label:  My Blog
    @pageTitle :label A Post
    @contentBlock :import-markdown: a-post.md
    @output :expand-expansion: @doctype<html>@headBlock<body>@pageTemplate</body></html>
    @output :export: post.html
```

## EXAMPLE

```
	shorthand /home/me/preamble.text
```

In this example a file containing the text of pre-amble is assigned to the 
label @PREAMBLE, the time 3:30 is assigned to the label {{NOW}}.

```
    {{PREAMBLE}} :import-text: /home/me/preamble.text
    {{NOW}} :label: 3:30

    At {{NOW}} I will be reading the {{PREAMBLE}} until everyone falls asleep.
```

If the file preamble.txt contained the phrase "Hello World" (including the 
quotes but without any carriage return or line feed) the output 
after processing the _shorthand_ would look like - 

```
    At 3:30 I will be reading the "Hello World" until everyone falls asleep.
```

Notice the lines containing the assignments are not included in the output and 
that no carriage returns or line feeds are added the the 
substituted labels.

+ Assign _shorthand_ expansions to a LABEL
    + LABEL :expand: SHORTHAND_TO_BE_EXPANDED
    + @content@ :expand: @report_name@ @report_date@
        + this would concatenate report name and date
